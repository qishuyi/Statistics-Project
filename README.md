# Statistics_Project
A stats research project that fits a multiple regression model to a dataset on agricultural emissions and explores the factors that contribute the most to agricultural emissions.  

`munger.py` is a Python script which takes in a csv file and outputs another csv file with values for each column averaged over ten years.  

The dataset is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
